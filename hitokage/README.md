Configuration files for
[hitokage](https://github.com/codyduong/hitokage),
a top status bar for Windows 11,
which interacts with
[komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi).

Place both files in `%USERPROFILE%\.config\hitokage\`.

I use `CommitMono Nerd Font` as the main font.
This can be changed in `styles.css`.

Documentation for configurations seems lacking.
