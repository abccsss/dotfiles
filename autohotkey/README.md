[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script on Windows 11
to do various things, including:

* <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> as <kbd>Esc</kbd> when pressed alone;

* <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> to toggle window borders;

* <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to centre window;

etc.

See [documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/index.htm) of the scripting language.

The <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> combination calls
[PowerToys Run](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld)
to switch between windows,
and requires PowerToys to be running.
